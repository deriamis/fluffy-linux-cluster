Fluffy cluster installation
---------------------------

At the moment you don't install.

0. Install the fakeunicast.ko kernel module from
	netfilter_fakeunicast/
	Depending on your kernel version, source code mods
	may be necessary. It is very simple.

2. In the "test directory", Run as root:
	./fluffycluster eth0 192.168.70.42

	Replace those with your interface and shared IP

	An optional third parameter gives the node weight
	(default=100)

4. Wait 5 seconds - you should now be able to connect to a
	tcp-based service on your host from a foreign source.

	If you can't connect from another node on the LAN, let 
	me know.

	If you can't connect from upstream, but can from the LAN,
	your upstream router may be implementing the RFC1812 
	recommendation correctly and ignoring ARPs which claim 
	a link-layer multicast address. I don't know how to 
	fix this at present (other than reconfigure your router
	not to do so).

5. Repeat the process on another node in the cluster -
	hash ranges should change (after 5 seconds) and

6. Attempt to connect to the cluster from another source
	- it should load balance the two machines accordingly.
	A new connection will be sent seemingly arbitrarily to
	one of the hosts in the cluster.


7. Pull the plug on one - it should notice and the other should
	transparently take over.

8. To stop a node, kill (ctrl-c) fluffycluster, then run
	cluster-stop.sh which should undo everything.
	Unload the kernel module if desired (it is fairly
	benign)
----------------

TODO:

b. Have a mechanism to change node weight on the fly
c. Detect link failures, so we don't get "split brain"
e. Detect clock adjustments so we don't get confused
	by them.
g. Have a simple config file, daemonise etc.
